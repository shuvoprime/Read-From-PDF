# Read-From-PDF
we need to use an external library known as ‘PyPDF’ (its recent version is PyPDF4 but we will be using PyPDF2)

PyPDF is capable of Extracting Document Information, Splitting Documents, Merging Documents, Cropping Pages in PDF, Encrypting and Decrypting, etc.

we are dealing with Text-based PDFs (the PDFs generated using word processing), because Image-based PDF needs to be handled with a different library known as ‘pyTesseract’

you have to install PyPDF2 first
